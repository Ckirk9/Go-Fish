User Stories / Game Logic 

- This is a two player game with a 52 card deck. 
- Each player is automatically dealt 7 random cards, the remaining 38 cards remain face down in the "pond". - Players can only see the cards in their hand.
- Each player is trying to get the most "books" a book is 4 cards of the same value. 
- Each player takes turns back and forth asking for the cards likely to build books. 
- Each turn the player will review thier hand of cards and ask the other player if they have a card that matches a card in their hand in an effort to create a book. 
- If the second player has the card that is being requested it is given to the asking player and the asking player is allowed to ask for another card. The turn continues until the second player does not have the card the asking player is asking for. At that point the second player responds "Go Fish" and the asking player will draw one card from the pond. 
- Any books that are built are placed face up on the board for everyone to see. 
- If a player has 7 books that player wins and the game is over. 
- If a player runs out of cards in their hand, their turn consists of drawing one card from the pond. 
- If the player has no cards and the pond is empty, the game is over for that player, but mathematically speaking 7 books will be created before this happens.
