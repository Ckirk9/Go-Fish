User Stories / Game Logic 

- This is a two player game with a 52 card deck. 
- To begin click "Let's Play" this will deal the cards.
- Each player is automatically dealt 7 random cards, the remaining 38 cards remain unseen in the deck. 
- Only player hand is displayed.
- Each player is trying to get the most "books" a book is 4 cards of the same value, the first player to get 7 books wins. 
- Each turn the player will review thier hand of cards and ask the other player if they have a card that matches a card in their hand in an effort to create a book. 
- If the second player has the card(s) of that value it is given to the asking player. If the second player does not have a card of that value the asking player will get a card from the deck -> "Go Fish".  
- If a player has 7 books that player wins and the game is over. 
- If a player runs out of cards in their hand, their turn consists of drawing one card from the pond. 
- If the player has no cards and the pond is empty, the game is over for that player, but mathematically speaking 7 books will be created before this happens.
